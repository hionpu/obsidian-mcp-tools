# Co-Located HAPDS (Human-AI Parallel Documentation System)

## Overview

The Co-Located HAPDS feature implements automatic compressed version management for Obsidian vaults. This system maintains both human-readable original documents (.md) and AI-optimized compressed versions (.aicomp) side by side, with automatic generation and intelligent selection.

## Key Features

### üîÑ Automatic Compression
- **Auto-Creation**: Compressed versions are automatically generated when files are created or updated
- **Auto-Selection**: Reading operations automatically prefer compressed versions when available
- **Fallback Safety**: Always falls back to original files if compressed versions are unavailable

### üìù Vault-Agnostic Design
- **Per-Vault Configuration**: Each vault can have its own compression rules via `_mcp/GenCompRules.md`
- **Default Rules**: Built-in fallback rules when custom configuration isn't present
- **Cross-Vault Compatibility**: Works independently across different vault structures

### ‚ö° Performance Optimized
- **Caching**: GenCompRules are cached for 5 minutes per vault to minimize API calls
- **Intelligent Fallback**: Graceful degradation when compression features aren't available
- **Parallel Operations**: Original and compressed files are managed simultaneously

## File Structure

```
your-vault/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _mcp/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ GenCompRules.md          # Vault-specific compression configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ document.md                  # Original human-readable version
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ document.md.aicomp          # AI-optimized compressed version
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ other-files...
```

## API Tools

### Enhanced File Operations

All vault file operations now include automatic compression management:

#### `get_vault_file`
- **Behavior**: Automatically returns compressed version if available, otherwise original
- **Indication**: Response includes source path and compression status
- **Fallback**: Seamlessly falls back to original if compressed version missing

#### `create_vault_file`
- **Behavior**: Creates both original (.md) and compressed (.aicomp) versions
- **Response**: Confirms creation of both versions with compression ratio
- **Fallback**: Creates original only if compression fails

#### `append_to_vault_file`
- **Behavior**: Updates original file and regenerates compressed version
- **Response**: Confirms updates to both versions
- **Optimization**: Regenerates compressed version from complete updated content

#### `patch_vault_file`
- **Behavior**: Patches original file and regenerates compressed version
- **Response**: Confirms patches to both versions with operation details
- **Consistency**: Ensures compressed version reflects all patches

#### `delete_vault_file`
- **Behavior**: Deletes both original and compressed versions
- **Response**: Confirms deletion of both files
- **Safety**: Continues if compressed version doesn't exist

### Compression Management

#### `manage_hapds_compression`
New tool for managing the compression system:

**Actions:**
- `status`: Check compression system status and configuration
- `clear_cache`: Clear GenCompRules cache to reload configuration
- `regenerate_compressed`: Manually regenerate compressed version for specific file

**Usage Examples:**
```json
// Check system status
{
  "action": "status"
}

// Clear rules cache
{
  "action": "clear_cache"
}

// Regenerate compressed version
{
  "action": "regenerate_compressed",
  "filename": "my-document.md"
}
```

## Configuration

### Setting Up GenCompRules

1. Create `_mcp/` directory in your vault root
2. Create `GenCompRules.md` in the `_mcp/` directory
3. Define your compression rules (see example below)

### Example GenCompRules.md

```markdown
# My Vault Compression Rules

## Core Rules
1. **Preserve Structure**: Keep all headers and markdown formatting
2. **Remove Verbosity**: Eliminate filler words and redundant explanations
3. **Compress Examples**: Consolidate multiple similar examples
4. **Maintain Code**: Keep all code blocks and technical content intact

## Transformation Patterns
- "In order to X, you need to Y" ‚Üí "To X: Y"
- Remove: "basically", "essentially", "obviously"
- Convert step lists to bullet points
- Remove redundant introductions

## Always Preserve
- Frontmatter/YAML
- Code blocks
- Links and references
- Technical terminology
- Data and measurements
```

### Default Rules

If no `_mcp/GenCompRules.md` is found, the system uses built-in default rules that:
- Optimize whitespace (reduce multiple newlines, trim spaces)
- Remove common filler words
- Convert verbose explanations to concise versions
- Compress step-by-step instructions to bullet points
- Preserve all critical content (code, links, data, frontmatter)

## Implementation Details

### Compression Algorithm

The compression system applies rules in this order:

1. **Load Rules**: Fetch from `_mcp/GenCompRules.md` or use defaults
2. **Whitespace Optimization**: Clean up excessive whitespace
3. **Pattern Matching**: Apply transformation patterns from rules
4. **Content Preservation**: Ensure critical content remains intact
5. **Quality Check**: Verify compressed version maintains readability

### File Naming Convention

- **Original**: `document.md`
- **Compressed**: `document.md.aicomp`
- **Consistent**: Same base name + `.aicomp` extension

### Caching Strategy

- **Rules Cache**: 5-minute TTL per vault to balance performance and freshness
- **Cache Key**: Based on vault root + rules file path
- **Auto-Refresh**: Cache expires automatically, reloading updated rules

### Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to original operations if compression fails
- **Clear Feedback**: Error messages indicate whether operations used compression
- **Non-Breaking**: Compression errors don't prevent core file operations

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Improved Performance**: Compressed versions load faster for AI processing
- **Space Efficiency**: Reduced storage and transfer overhead
- **Maintained Readability**: Original documents remain unchanged
- **Transparent Operation**: Compression happens automatically

### For AI Systems
- **Optimized Content**: Reduced noise and improved signal-to-noise ratio
- **Faster Processing**: Smaller files mean faster analysis and response
- **Consistent Format**: Standardized compression reduces variability
- **Preserved Context**: Critical information remains intact

## Migration

### Existing Vaults
- **Zero Migration**: Existing vaults work immediately without changes
- **Gradual Adoption**: Compressed versions created as files are accessed/updated
- **Optional Configuration**: Custom rules can be added at any time

### Backward Compatibility
- **Full Compatibility**: All existing tools continue to work unchanged
- **Transparent Enhancement**: Compression adds functionality without breaking existing workflows
- **Selective Usage**: Can be disabled by avoiding the HAPDS management tools

## Best Practices

### Rule Configuration
1. **Start Conservative**: Begin with default rules, customize gradually
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify compressed versions maintain essential information
3. **Document Changes**: Keep notes on rule modifications and their effects
4. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and update compression rules

### File Management
1. **Monitor Ratios**: Check compression ratios to ensure effectiveness
2. **Regenerate Periodically**: Use `regenerate_compressed` for important files after rule changes
3. **Backup Strategy**: Include both .md and .aicomp files in backups
4. **Cache Management**: Clear cache after significant rule changes

### Performance Optimization
1. **Appropriate Compression**: Target 20-40% size reduction for optimal balance
2. **Cache Awareness**: Understand 5-minute cache TTL for rule changes
3. **Batch Operations**: Consider regenerating multiple files after major rule updates
4. **Monitor Performance**: Watch for any performance impacts on large vaults

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Compressed versions not being created:**
- Check `_mcp/GenCompRules.md` syntax
- Verify vault permissions
- Use `manage_hapds_compression` with `status`

**Rules not taking effect:**
- Clear cache with `clear_cache` action
- Check 5-minute cache TTL
- Verify rule syntax in GenCompRules.md

**Performance issues:**
- Monitor compression ratios
- Adjust rule aggressiveness
- Consider vault-specific rule optimization

### Debug Commands

```json
// Check system status
{"action": "status"}

// Clear rules cache
{"action": "clear_cache"}

// Test specific file compression
{"action": "regenerate_compressed", "filename": "test.md"}
```
